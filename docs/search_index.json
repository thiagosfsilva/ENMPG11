["index.html", "ENMPG11 Geomatics - Module Workbook Welcome!", " ENMPG11 Geomatics - Module Workbook Thiago Silva 2020-02-27 Welcome! Welcome to the ENMPG11 Geomatics module workbook! This module provides an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of Geomatics, i.e. how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Earth Observation (EO) to perform spatial data analysis and visualisation. As Geomatics is best taught through hands-on practice, this module is based on the flipped classroom method, where you will be assigned videos and/or readings on a weekly basis, and then we will meet twice a week for computer-based practicals. In each practical class you will be taken through a number of exercises that will teach you fundamental skills in GIS and EO. Use the items on the left to navigate through the sections of the workbook, and click on the arrows at the left and right edges of the main page are to page forward/backward. If you are viewing the book on a small screen, the navigation buttons will be on the bottom instead. "],

One of the best things you can get out of this module is learning how to become an independent Geomatics user. Once you graduate, you will be on your own and expected to be proficient in these tools! Any questions or comments regarding module content and assessments should be posted on the Discussion page on CANVAS, so that answers are visible to everyone. Questions of this nature sent via e-mail will not be replied to. Requests for extension on assignments should be submitted directly through CANVAS without the need to send a prior e-mail to the module coordinator. Questions regarding personal and/or sensitive issues related to the module should be sent directly by e-mail to the module coordinator. Please add the keyword ENMPG11 to your e-mail subject. 1.2 About the Module Geomatics is defined in the ISO/TC 211 standards as the “discipline concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of geographic data or geographic information”.It is an integrative discipline encompassing Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Earth Observation (EO, a.k.a Remote Sensing), and satial surveying methods. These technologies have become vitally important tools in ecological and environmental management and are being increasingly used by scientists, governmental agencies and NGOs for the assessment, monitoring and management of global resources. This course will provide an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of GIS and EO, and how they are now widely used to support ecological and environmental management objectives. You will be introduced to modern methods for manipulating and analysing geospatial data of various sources and formats. Hands-onpractical sessions will examine various real-world applications of GIS and EO in environmental management. As the name implies, Geo-matics can be tought as “informatics for geographic data”. This is a computer intensive module that will require you to be comfortable using complex computer software and knowlegeable in managing files and folders. Also, as with any complex piece software, stuff will often not work at first. This is regardless of software source, version, vendor of platform. Learning how to independently troubleshoot when things don’t work as they should is a MAJOR part of being proficient in Geomatics, so be prepared for it! 1.3 Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO’s): By the end of this module, you should be able to: Select and apply appropriate GIS/EO functions based on spatial theory; Describe the physical principles underlying remote sensing in the optical and microwave domains and the respective uses of the data provided by these sensors; Critically differentiate sources and structures of geospatial datasets; Analyse and visualise geospatial data using open source software and programming languages. 1.4 Readings and Resources If you have any questions about how QGIS works, your first stop should be the QGIS documentation: (https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/index.html) There are no prescribed textbooks, but some readings are suggested below. Students are expected to read widely from the peer-reviewed literature to consolidate their understanding of course materials. Textbooks: Heywood D.I., Cornelius S., &amp; Carver S. 2006.

["lab1.html", "2 Lab 1 - QGIS overview and file management 2.1 Guided Exercise 1 - A simple GIS workflow 2.2 Self-guided exercise", " 2 Lab 1 - QGIS overview and file management 2.1 Guided Exercise 1 - A simple GIS workflow The purpose of this exercise is to give you a general overview of proper GIS workflow, from start to end. Throughout the module, your exercises and projects wil become more complex, but the general workflow will not change. Getting used to having proper project and file management habits from the start is the best thing you can learn. Speaking as someone whi has been teaching and working with Geomatics for more than a decade, poor file/project managemnt is the underlying cause of at least 50% of the GIS problems you may encounter. 2.1.1 Creating a project structure GIS projects generate a lot of different files quickly, so project organization is essential. The steps below are my suggestion for organizing GIS projects files and associated data. Once you get comfortable managing your own projects, feel free to change the proposed structure to something that best suits your own workflow. Create a folder on your computer called ENMPG11, off of the main data drive. For Windows, this will be C: in most cases, unless you have separate disk drives. For Linux and Mac, create it on you home drive. Windows C: mac OS home Ubuntu home Having complex file paths is a major source of problems. That is why we keep our main projects folder off a base folder. NEVER use spaces or special symbols on your folder and file names. Limit yourself to using letters A-Z and a-z, numbers 1-9 and just the underline (_) and dash (-) symbols. Remember that linux and Mac OS systems differentiate between upper and lower case letters, so ‘Filename.txt’ and ‘filename.txt’ are considered different. Windows does not differentiate cases, so the examples abovw would overwrite each other when saving. Inside the ENPG11 folder, create a subfolder called lab_1 Inside lab_1, create the following folder structure: This is the most “barebones” project structure you can have. The folders will bee used as follows: 00_qgis: we will use this folder to save our QGIS project files. 01_raw_data: this folder will keep all the original data files you are working with. This way you can always go back to the start if something goes wrong. We use the subfoldrrs vector and raster to easily know which data type we are working with. You should create additional subfolders inside each folder to keep things organized as you go. 02_processing: here we will keep all th files you generate as part of your work. Make ample use of subfolders to identify each step of the workflow. 03_final_products: here we will keep the final products of our intended analysis. This makes it easy for us to find the latest version of our intended outputs, without risking using intremediate files instead 04_docs: here we will keep all our non-GIS files. In the notes folder, you can keep a simple text file documenting the project steps as you work in it. You can also keeo important referece images here. In images, you can save any image that illustrates the steps you made, or maps you have produced. You can add other subfolders such as report if you are writing a report about your project, and keep the report file in there. Organize the data you’ve downloaded previosuly during the instructor-led QGIS exploration into your projec folder. The terrain data folder goes into raster, the roads data goes into vector, and the .txt metadata files go into docs/notes. You can keep the data into the original folders they came in, for easy identification: 2.1.2 Creating a QGIS project A QGIS project is an index file that will remember all the data layers you have loaded, their stacking order, the styling of each layer, and some other information, such as a default map projection and datum. It will also keep any map layouts that you create. **It will NOT store the data files!!*. Create a new project in QGIS by clicking on Project &gt; New... or pressing Ctrl-N: Add the layers NS_RoadLink.shp and NS89.asc from your organized project folder (terrain and roads) to your project. Save your project. Click on the Save button and give your project a name, nd save it on ENMPG11/lab_1/00_qgis. Open the project settings by clicking on Project &gt; Properties.... You will see this window: The main thing to set on your new project are the project home folder, the base map projection info and the measurement units. For the project home on the General tab, select the lab_1 folder. This helps navigating when opening and saving data. For measurement units, make sure distance units are set in meters, and area units in squared meters, also on the General tab. For base projection, go to the CRS tab and search for OSGB 1936 British National Grid, identified by the EPSG code 7405. EPSG stands for “European Petroleum Survey Group”, and designates a parameter database with standard codes for geodesic information. Over time, you will propbably memorize the EPSG codes for the projections you use more often, making it easy to search for Select it by clicking on it. Save your project by clicking on the Save button, or going to Project &gt; Save, or by typing Ctrl+S simultaneously. 2.1.3 Styling your layers and producing a simple map Select the NS89 layer on the Layers side panel, and drag it to the bottom of the layers list if not there already. Turn the roads layer off for now. Right-click on the layer name and choose Rename Layer. Rename it to Digital Elevation Model (50m). Open the file exlplorer in your system, and look for the NS89.asc file you have saved before. Stop and think: will changing a layer name in the layer panel also change the name of the source data file for that layer? Right clik on the terrain layer and choose Zoom to Layer. This is always a handy tool to “find yourself” if you end up zooming or panning the map too far. Pick a layer that covers most of your intended work area and zoom to it. (Advanced: you can also set a Spatial Bookmark by going to View &gt; New Spatial Bookmark...(Ctrl + B). You bookmarks will show on your Browser side panel, below your Favorites). Right click on the terrain layer name and select Properties..., then go to the Symbology tab. Select Rendering type to be Single Band Pseudocolor, and Color Ramp as spectral. Click again on the down arrow button to the right of the Color Ramp box, and select Invert Color Ramp, so that the minimum heights are colored blue. Then click OK. Save your project. Stop and think: Why bother inverting the color ramp for this dataset? Rename the NS_RoadLink layer to Road Network. Go to its Symbology properties and click on Simple Line. Change the line color to a mid-grey, and the line width to 0.3. Click OK. Reactivate the layer to visualise it. Go to the Vector menu and select Research Tools &gt; Extract Layer Extent.... Select the terrain layer as your Input layer, and click Run to generate a temporary layer. This layer will not be kept once you close QGIS, unless you save it manually later. The window will not close automatically once you run, so remember to click on Close when you are done. Go to Vector &gt; Geoprocessing Tools &gt; Clip.... Select the roads layer as the Input Layer and the new temporary layer as the Overlay Layer. This time, we will save the output. Click on the ... button to the right of the Clipped text box, and then choose Save to file. Save your new layer on ENMPG11/lab_1/processing, naming it clipped_roads.shp. Make sure the SHP file format is selected below the file name. Turn the original roads layer on and off to see the result of your operation. Then right-click on the original roads layer, and select Styles &gt; Copy Style &gt; All Style Categories. Then right click on the new (clipped) roads layer and select Styles &gt; Paste Style &gt; All Style Categories. Remove the original roads layer from your project and save the project. Close QGIS. Stop and think: what does the warning given by QGIS when you try to close it means? Reopen QGIS, and load back your project. Notice it remembers exaclty where you last saved it, including zoom level, layer names and layer styles. If the “Extent” layer still shows on the side panel, remove it (as the source data file was not saved, this entry now links to nothing). Click on Project &gt; New Map Layout and name it Lab 1 Layout. A new window will open with the QGIS Layout Editor. Add a new map to the layout by clicking on the icon. Drag it through the page so it covers about 2/3 of it horizontally, and the full page (minus borders) vertically. Use the Interactive Extent tool to pan and zoom until your data uses most of the map area. Make sure you are not hiding the edges of your map with too much zoom! Now fine tune the map scale by changing the Scale value on the right panel. Remember that this value means “1:value”, meaning 1 unit on the page is equal to that many units (value) in the real world. This means larger numbers will “zoom out”, and smaller numbers will “zoom in”. Try to make the map fill as much as possible of the map box, without clipping the edges. Go to the menu Add Item &gt; Add Legend... (notice the icon for this option, and find it on the side toolbar). Click the area beside the map box and drag to add a legend. Go back to the main QGIS window, right click on the terrain layer name, and on the Symblogy tab, change the Mode under the class color box to Equal Interval, and select the number of Classes to 10 (to the right of the Equal Interval box). Go back top the Map Layout eritor. Go to the menu Add Item &gt; Add Scalebar (notice the icon for this option, and find it on the side toolbar). Click and drag below the legend to add it to the map layout. Add a title to your map using the Add Label... tool (either on the Add Item menu or selecting the tool directly from the lef sidebar). You can change the text by replacing the “Lorem ipsum” placeholder with your own text on the left pane. Try to make it Bold with a font size of 16. Rearrange the items on the page until you are pleased with the results. Then go to Layout &gt; Export as PDF..., and export your map, naming it properly and saving it on ENMPG11/lab_1/products. Save your map layout by clicking on the save button in the Map Layout Window and close it. Then save your Project on the main QGIS window and close QGIS as well. Reopen QGIS, and go to Project &gt; Layout Manager. The layout you created previosuly show appear on the list. Select it and click on Show. Congratulations! You have sucessfully finished your first GIS project, using proper file management practices. As a final suggestion, create a “workflow_notes” file on ENPMG11/lab1/notes and write up a quick overview of what you did, along with any specific notes you would like to remember later. 2.2 Self-guided exercise Create a new project folder for this new project, under your main ENMPG11 work folder. Then obtain layers for “Sites of Special Scientific Interest” from The Scottish Natural Heritage Natural Spaces collection: https://gateway.snh.gov.uk/natural-spaces/. Use the ESRI Shapefile data format. Then also obtain data for roads and rivers from the Ordnance Survey Open Data page: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html. Again, use the ESRI Shapefile format. Organize all the layers into your project folders as suitable, and then produce a map of a SSSI area of your choice, showing the SSSI, roads and rivers, at a map scale of 1:150000 (meaning a smaller real world distance). Save your analysis as a project, and export your map as a PDF. "],

It will cover both some geometry operations and attribute operations. Try to apply all the steps you have already learned on previous modules here as well: create a project folder, organize your data, save a named project with proper projection info, etc. The expectation is that you build up upon previous activities on each consecutive lab, so towards the end of the module you feel empowered to carry on with your own project. 3.1 Guided Exercise 1 - Basic work with Vector Data Dowload the data for this exercise from the link below, then extract the zipfiles. https://stir-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ts35_stir_ac_uk/En54tCrr8_NNl9dCo9Wa2hEBItv9QecNaVWL09p9j3EYnA?e=rXF5x4 Load all datasets in QGIS and inspect them: Stop and think: What are the datasets you have? What are the file types you have to work with? Which of these files contain metadata about your datasets? What are the file formats you have to work with? What is the Map Projection of each data layer you have? Once you have the answers to the above questions, exit QGIS without saving. Then create a structured project folder, and distribute the datafiles accordingly. Then reopen QGIS, load the data from the organized project folder, check you Project properties to make sure they are correct and then save your project file within your organized folder structure as well. Now inspect the attributes for each layer: Stop and think: How many attributes does each layer have? How many features does each layer have? What are the different data types among all attributes? Rename your layers on the layer list using human-readable, informative names. Save your project Organize the layer order and play with different layer superpositions to make the best visualization for all datasets involved. Then experiment with the symbology of each layer to improve your visualization. 3.2 Guided Exercise 2: Operations using layer attributes Turn off the Rivers and Earthquakes layers. Go to Layer Properties &gt; Symbology for the World Countries layer, and change the option from Single Symbol to Categorized. For value, choose REGION_UN. Leave the Symbol option as is, and for Color Ramp, select Random Colors. Then click on Classify on the bottom left of the window. Then click on OK. Stop and think: Why is this symbology option called Categorized? Return to the Symbology window and select Graduated instead of Categorized. Change your Value to POP_EST. Choose Magma as your color ramp, change Mode (below empty space) to Equal interval, leave Classes as 5, and then click on Classify. Click OK. Return to the Symbologywindow, change mode from Equal Interval to Natural Breaks (Jenks), and increase Class to 10. Click on OK. Stop and think: Why is this symbology option called Graduated? Turn on the Rivers layer, and open its attribute table. Click on the Select features using expression button: On the middle column, go to Fields and Values and then double click on KILOMETERS. It will be added to the left column. Complete the expression so it reads &quot;KILOMETERS&quot; &gt; 5000. Check the results of your selection on both the Attribute Table and the plotted layer geometry. Stop and think: Does it seem like the selection is missing a few famous longest rivers? Why would that be? Change your expression to &quot;SYSTEM&quot; = 'Amazon' and run a new selection. On the bottom left of the Attibute Table, select Show Selected Features. How many rivers are there in the Amazon system, according to this dataset? Back on the main QGIS window, click on the Show Statistical Summary tool. A new pane will open. Select the Rivers layer as input, then click on the bottom on Selected Features Only. Then select Kilometers on the drop-down menu under the layer name. What is the length, in kilometers, of all rivers of the Amazon system combined? Stop and think: Does it seem like the selection is missing a few famous longest rivers? Why would that be? Go back to the Attibute Table window for the Rivers layer. Click on the Field Calculator tool (). On the new window, uncheck the Only update selected features options if it is checked. Then name the new field Miles_Km, and change the output type to Decimal Number. On the expression window, write &quot;MILES&quot; / &quot;KILOMETERS&quot;. Note the warning at the bottom. Once you click OK, turn off editing mode by clicking on the icon. Save you layer when asked to. Stop and think: Does the Miles to Km conversion factor you calculated seem right? Click on the Delete Field button (), and select Miles_Km. Click OK. Then click on the Deselect All button, to clear your previous selection of Amazon system rivers. Click on the Add Field button (). Create a field named Region, of Text(string) type, and Length of 50. Click OK. Return to the Field Calculator, and select Update Existing Field instead. Select Region as the field to be updated, and then simply type 'Unknown' on the Expression window. Don’t forget the quotes. Click OK. Exit edit mode choosing yes to save your edits. Save your project! 3.3 Guided Exercise 3 - Spatial Queries Go to Vector &gt; Research Tools &gt; Select by Location.... Select the Earthquakes layer as Select features from. Then check only the Are within query option. As the comparison layer, choose your World Countries layer. Take a look at the options under Modify current selection by, and then set it at Creating New Selection. Click Run, and after it is finished, click Close. Open the Attibute Table for the Earthquakes layer. Stop and think: - How many Earthquakes were originated on land in 2011? On the Field Calculator, create a new field called Origin. Do keep the option Only update selected features checked. The field should be of text type and length 10, and on the Expression window, write 'Land'. On the Attribute Table window, click on ‘Invert Selection’(). Then return to the Field Calculator and Update the Origin field by designating the newly selected features as 'Ocean'. Style your points by ‘Origin’ using the Symbology options. On the World layer, use Attribute selection (as done on Exercise 2) to select all countries from South America. Then go to Vector &gt; Research Tools &gt; Select by Location... and select all Earthquakes that are contained within the Countries layer (same process as item 1 above), but this time make sure you turn the option Selected features only on. Right-click on the Earthquakes layer name on the left panel and choose Export &gt; Save selected features as.... Name you exported file as Land_earthquakes_2011_south_america, choose the appropriate folder to save it within your project structure by clicking on the ... button to the left of the file name box, and select your format of choice (Geopackage or Shapefile).

["lab3.html", "4 Lab 3 - Working with vector data - Geoprocessing Tools 4.1 Guided Exercise 1 - Clipping data", " 4 Lab 3 - Working with vector data - Geoprocessing Tools (STILL INCOMPLETE, BEAR WITH ME ) During the previous lab, we looked at how to solve probles using vector attributes, making selections based on both attribute values and on spatial relations. For this exercise, we will learn how to do operations on the vector geometries instead. 4.1 Guided Exercise 1 - Clipping data Dowload the data for this exercise from the link below, then extract the zipfiles. Load all datasets in QGIS and inspect them: Stop and think: What are the datasets you have? What are the file types you have to work with? What are the file formats you have to work with? What is the Map Projection of each data layer you have? Use attribute search to select all the roads from the land cover/land use layer (ITEM2012 field). Pay attention to all the possible classes that indicate a road. ( HINTS: Use the button Values on the right. then the option All unique values to quickly see all possible values of a given attribute. Use or if you need features to fulfill either criteria. Use and if you need all features to fulfill all criteria. Computers are dumb so you need to be very explicit. If you are making a compound search, you need to name the attributes and the boolean operation everytime, even if it is the same: Correct: ATT_NAME = ‘X’ or ATT_NAME = ‘Y’ Wrong: ATT_NAME = ‘X’ or ‘Y’ Visualize your layer to see if it look correct. Now, create a buffer of 1km around all roads in the dataset, using Vector &gt; Geoprocessing &gt; Buffer.... Select your new roads layer as the Input layer, define the distance as 1000 meters and leave everything else as default. Click on Run and then Close the window when it’s done. Stop and think: Where the results what you expected? What happened? Remove the temporary buffer layer you created, and return to Vector &gt; Geoprocessing &gt; Buffer.... Use the same parameters as before, but this time, check the Dissolve result box. Run and Close. Stop and think: What did the Dissolve result option do? Now we want to compute the amount of forest areas that are within 1km of any road. For that, first we need to Clip our land cover dataset using our buffer. Go to Vector &gt; Geoprocessing &gt; Clip and select UK004L1_GLASGOW_UA2012_roads as the Input layer, and your newly created buffer as the Overlay layer. Run and Close. Inspect the new layer you have created. Use Symbology to make the land use classes visible. Then save your layer by right-clicking on the Clipped layer name and selecting Make layer permanent. Select the spahefile format and name it as you like. Then add the newly created layer to the project. Stop and think: Why were the colors not saved with the file? Right-clik on the Clipped layer you colred by class before, and then select Styles &gt; Copy Styles &gt; All Style categories. Then right click on your new saved layer, and select Styles &gt; Paste Styles &gt; All Style Categories. Now remove the Clipped layer from the project. Go to the Symbology window of the new clipped layer, and remove all classes except for Forest, by selecting them and using the - (minus) button at the bottom of the list.

But there are plenty of situations where vectors are not the best choice; any information that varies gradually and continuously over the surface can be better represented by rasters For this exercise, we will learn to inspect and style raster data, and also how to do some mathematical operations among raster layers. 5.1 Guided Exercise 1 - Opening and inspecting raster data Download the required data for Lab 4 from the lab data link on Canvas. Download additional data from . You want the offical country divisions for the United Kingdom. Pick Geopackage or Shapefile, your choice. Open the four layers contained in the UK administrative boundary data. Keep the layer that shows only the overall boundaries for the UK, and remove the others from the project. Add the UK_SRTM.tif, UK_Bioclim.tif and CLC2018_CLC2018_V2018_20_UKclip.tif raster files to your project. For each of them, right-click on the layer name and go to Properties &gt; Information, then: Stop and think: What are the datasets you have? What are the file types you have to work with? What are the file formats you have to work with? What are the map projections of each dataset you have (vector and raster)? What are the lenght units of each raster dataset? What are the data types of each raster dataset? What are the dimensions (rows, columns) of each raster dataset? How many bands does each raster dataset have? What are the pixel sizes of each raster dataset? 5.2 Guided Exercise 2 - Styling raster data Select the CORINE land cover data layer and go to Properties &gt; Symbology. Not that the default symbology for single band rasters is Singleband gray. Change it to Paletted / Unique Values. Maintain the Random Colors option, and classify. Aplly the result to your raster and visualise it. Stop and think: How many categories are there on this raster? What do the numbers represent? Fortunately for us, the data producers of CORINE include a color map file as part of the metadata. Back on the Symbology window, click on the ... to the right of Delete All and choose Load Color Map from File.... Find and select the metadata file named CLC2018_CLC2018_V2018_20_QGIS.txt. Apply and then click OK. Thank you CORINE team! Now go to the Symbology window for the Bioclim dataset. Notice that the default symbology choice for multiband rasters is Multiband color. That option is appropriate for satellite images and aerial photography, where each band represents a different region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and then bands can be assigned to the Red, Green and Blue color channels of your screen. Since our data does not comprise images, but layers where pixel values represent real variables, we need to use the Single band - pseudocolor option. Choose the bio1 band, and select the magma color ramp. Classify the existing values and then Apply and click OK. Stop and think: What data is bio01 showing? What units are the minimum and maximum values shown on the color scale? Why such a strange choice for the units? Return to the Symbology window, and expand the option Min / Max Value Settings. What is the default option selected? Experiment with the other options (with different percent clips and standard deviations) and see how the Symbology changes. Remember to Apply the changes every time you change any options. Still on the Symbology window, change the Classification options (drop down menu to the left, under the classes) from Continuous to Equal Interval. To the right of it, select the numnber of classes as 3. Apply and evaluate. Without changing your number of classes, change the Interpolation option above the classes from Linear to Discrete. Apply and evaluate. Take some time to play with these visualisation options to analyse the distribution of different Bioclimatic variables in the UK, and think what they mean for plants, (non-human) animals and in terms of social and economic factors. Finally, let’s work on the Symbology for the SRTM data. On the Symbology window, choose the Singleband Pseudocolor option, and then on the Color Ramp option, select Create New Color Ramp. On the small options window that comes up, select Catalog:cpt-city. Once the catalog window opens, go to the Topography list and select the cd-a palette. Then classify your elevation values using the User Defined Min /Max option, and type 0 as Min and 900 as Maximum. Apply and visualise. Then, befor closing the Properties window, go to the Transparency table and drag the slider at the top to around 60%. Right-click on the SRTM layer name and select Duplicate layer. Then on the Symbology of the copied layer, change the render type to Hillshade. Apply and close the window. Make sure the copied layer is immediately under the original layer, and alternate each layer between on and off. Stop and think: What does the hillshade render style does? How? 5.3 Guided Exercise 3 - Mathematical and boolean operations using the Raster Calculator Go to the menu Raster &gt; Raster Calculator.... This tool allows you to apply several mathematical funtions to raster layer values and even to do calculations among values. First, find the Bio1 layer of the Biolcim raster. From the metadata, we know it is the first band, so double-click UK_bioclim@1 to add it to the expression area. In this context @1, @2, etc. indicate the respective raster band number. As we saw above, the Bio1 layer corresponds to Annual Average Temperature, with a unit of degrees Celsius multiplied by ten. Let’s convert it to regular degree Celsius units. On the expression area, after UK_bioclim@1, write / 10. Then, on the top right corner, select a folder to save your file and name it appropriately. Then click OK. Style your new layer in the same style used for the original Bio1 layer, using the full Min / Max range, and marvel at the abysmal maximum average temperature values for the UK. Can you spot the London heat island effect? Let’s say we would like to relocate to the hottest (in average) locations of the UK. Go back to raster calculator, and enter the expression UK_bioclim@1 &gt; 100 (or use your new layer and select areas &gt; 10). Save the result as UKs_last_hope.tif. Go to the Symbology layer of your newly created layer and select Paletted / Unique Values, then Classify. Then, remove the 0 values from the legend using the - (minus) button. Click on the color box for the 1 values and select a strong red color. Finally, go to the Transparency tab and drag the slider to around 50%. Then Apply and close the window. Position your temperature range layer just above the terrain and hillshade layers, and make sure only these three are visible. 5.4 Guided Exercise 3 - Masking and reprojecting raster data. It may have been bothering you that the UK seems “squished” during your work. That is because the data is ‘unprojected’, using only the WGS-84 datum geograophic coordinates. Although data in geographic coordinates is often referred to as “unprojected”, this is not actually true (you are looking at it on flat screen, right?). For these “unprojected” datasets, what most GIS software do is to simply use a linear function to convert latitudes and longitudes in degrees to x and y values on your screen. This projection can be referred as Plate Carrée or Equirectangular projection, where degree coordinates are simply converted to radians and multiplied by a scale factor to become x and y coordinates. This projection has a heavy amount of distortion towards the poles: To reproject the data, go to Raster &gt; Projections &gt; Warp (Reproject...). Select your SRTM layer as the Input Layer, and the EPSG: 27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid as the output projection. Set the output file resolution to 90 (this will be in meters, as meters are the units of the BNG projection). Then save your file as UK_SRTM_BNGreproj.tif. Run the algorithm and then Close when finished. Repeat the process for the Bioclim layer (use a cell size of 1000m), your “last hope” layer and the CORINE landcover map (cell size of 100m). It seems nothing has really changed, right? That is because QGIS does reprojections “on the fly” to make sure the data in the screen are as best aligned as possible. As the project always takes the Coordinate System of the first layer added to it, it is set to Geographic WGS84, and it is reprojecting your BSG files back to WGS84 to align them with the WGS84 data. CLose your project, and then start a new project, loading only the BSG reprojected layers. Does it look better now? We often want to remove parts (specific cells) of a raster, a process called masking. For example, let’s say we want to get the mean average annual temperature andvisualize the temprature ranges for out “last hope” regions only. Lets go to the Raster Calculator, and use the expression (UK_Biolcim@1 / 10) * UKs_last_hope@1. Name the resulting layer and save it, then style the result using a Pseudocolor color ramp. However, this time manually specify the Min value as 10. Stop and think: what happened to the temperature values when we applied the expression above? Use the information tool to probe a few values of the new raster to help you think about it. Return to the Properties of the new masked layer, and select the Transparency tab. On the table named Transparent pixel list, click on the + (plus) button to add a new line. Fill the line with the values from = 0, to = 0 and Percent Transparent = 100. Apply and evaluate the result. Stop and think: did you actually change the contents of the raster layer when you set the transparent pixels? Vectors can also be used as masks. Go to Raster &gt; Extraction &gt; CLip Raster by Mask Layer.... Select your Celsius converted average temperature raster as input layer, the gadm36_GBR_0 as your mask layer, and check keep the resolution of the input raster. Run the algorithm (it will take a while) then Close the window when finished. Copy the layer style from the original UK_SRTM to the masked layer, zoom to the original UK_SRTM layer extent and compare the results before and after the masking. Now click on the menu Processing &gt; Toolbox.... Welcome to the QGIS toolbox! You will find many addtional functions here to process vectors ans rasters, as well as functions from external software that can be accesses through QGIS. On the search bar at the top, search for Raster layer zonal statistics. Double click on the tool with that name that comes up from the search. As Input layer, select the degree Celsius temeprature layer you created, and as Zones layer, select the “last hope” layer (the one with the 0/1 values, not the masked temoerature layer). Run (it will take a while) and then Close. 5.5 Formative Assessment Is there any difference in mean values of average annual temperature between urban areas and forests in the UK? Make a map (including legend and scale) showing you results visually. Hint 1: To ensure raster operations work properly, all rasters must be in the same projection. Hint 2: You can also use AND and OR to create compound expressions on the raster calculator (just make sure you type them in all caps). "],

Today, we will continue discovering new ways of working with rasters, and also start to integrate rasters and vectors into combined analyses. 6.1 Guided Exercise 1 - Converting rasters to vectors For the previous lab, you used (or tried to use) a function to extract zonal statistics from rasters, using a second raster as a mask. The process was very computer intensive, however, making it not usable on older computers. Stop and think: Thinking back on what you know about rasters now, why would this processes be so computer intensive? However, there is a second option, which is to use vector layers as the zones for extracting statistics. Download the required data for the previous lab (lab 4) if you don’t have it ready to go anymore, and the data for lab 5 from the lab data link on Canvas. Don’t forget to the dowload the UK boundaries again from the GADM website: https://gadm.org/ Recreate the raster layers UK_Bioclim_temp_celsius.tif and UKs_last_hope.tif if you don’t have them anymore. Stop and think: Did you take time during the last practical to organize your project folder and back up your work data before leaving the classroom? Or did you have to re-do the analysis? Remember, project organization and backups might be the difference between doing very well vs. not so well in this module! Now go to Raster &gt; Conversion &gt; Polygonize (Raster to vector).... Select your “last hope” layer as the input, and leave everything else as default. Run and then Close. There is a bug on QGIS 3.10.1 where it can’t find the polygonize script. Follow the instructions below to fix it. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/33386#issuecomment-569140502 Stop and think: What did you get as a result? Are all of the resulting polygons needed? Open the attibute table of your newly created vector layer, and do an attibute selection to select all polygons where DN = 0. Close the selection window, confirm your selection is correct, and then click on Delete selected features. Then save your edits and turn off editing mode. Make your layer permanent as UKs_last_hope_vectorized.shp. Stop and think: What does DN mean? 6.2 Guided Exercise 2 - Zonal statistics redux If it’s not visible already, enable your Processing Toolbox panel by going to Processing &gt; Toolbox.... Search for the function Zonal statistics (Not Raster layer zonal statistics) and double click on it to open the tool window. Select the UK celsius layer as the Raster layer and you vectorized “last hope” layer as the Vector layer containing zones. Then click on the button to the side of Statistics to calculate, and check Stdev, Min and Max in addition to the three already checked. Also, set the prefix as LH_. Run and close. Open the attribute table of the vectorized “last hope” layer. You will find the required statistics calculated for each polygon, as new attributes. Set the symbology of your new vector layer as a Graduated color ramp for LH_max. Where should a person live in the UK if they don’t like the cold? 6.3 Guided exercise 3 - Terrain Analysis One of the most often used raster datasets are terrain data. These are generally called Digital Elevation Models or DEMs. If you are certain that these elevations represent the bare surface of the Earth (i.e. no trees, buildings, etc.) then it is also a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). If it represents the overall top of varied surfaces (tops of treees, tops of buildings, etc.) then it is a Digital Surface Model (DSM): DSM, DTM and Aerial Photo of the same site Open the UK_SRTM.tif layer from Lab 4. SRTM stands for Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. It was a mission flown by NASA in Febryary 2000 to acquire accurate topographical data for the entire globe. There are multiple versions of SRTM around, with the two main ones being the High-Resolution (1 arc-sec, ~30m) data directly distributed by NASA, currenlty on version 3, and the coarser 3 arc-second (~90m) resolution data provided by the Consortium for Spatial Information (CSI), which has further processing to correct data problems. SRTM (NASA): https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/ SRTM (CSI): https://cgiarcsi.community/data/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v4-1/ Apply a good Symbology to the layer to make changes in elevation more visible. Apply a mask to the elevation data, using the UK boundaries vector layer as explained on the previous lab. This time, type -999 to the Assign a specific nodata value to output bands. This will help keep the ocean “transparent” when viewing the data. We can’t do that on the original data because the ocean is at 0m elevation, so if we set the symbology of “0” values transparent, we also lose the edges of coastal regions, and any interior areas lower than 0m. Keep it as a temporary layer for now. Now we need to reproject the raster to a projected system that has horizontal units in meters. Since slope is calculated based on vertical distance travelled vs. horizontal distance travelled, we need both to be in the same units or we’ll get very strange results. As done on the previous practical, reproject your temporary masked layer to BSG, and save it as UK_SRTM_masked_BSG.tif. The close your project and start a new one with this layer only. Go to Raster &gt; Analysis &gt; Slope.... Select the masked UK DEM as the input layer, and leave everything else as default. Run and Close. Style both the elevation layer and the slope lay using continuous color ramps, and compare your resulting layer with the UK elevation layer. Stop and think: What is the result of this tool? What are the units and what do they represent? Another terrain metric that is very useful is called aspect, and it indicated to which cardinal direction the slope is facing. Changes in slope orientation often imply in different amounts of total daily and annual insolation, and total annual precipitation. To calculate it, go to Raster &gt; Analysis &gt; Aspect.... Select the option Return zero for flat instead of -9999. Then Run and Close. Style it and compare to the other two layers. Remember to always use the elevation layer as the input for any terrain calculation. There are two other terrain metrics (or geomorphometric variables) easily acessible in QGIS: Terrain Position Index (TPI) and Terrain Ruggedness Index( TRI). Their description can be found in the QGIS User Manual: https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/gdal/rasteranalysis.html#terrain-ruggedness-index-tri https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/gdal/rasteranalysis.html#terrain-ruggedness-index-tri What they both try to capture is the general “rugedness” of the terrain, i.e. does it strecth for long, flat areas or does it have many abrupt variations in elevation?. Calculate both by acessing them on the Raster &gt; Analsis... menu. Stop and think: What is the result of this tool? What are the units and what do they represent? Extract the data from the Dumyat.zip. This data has been dowloaded from DigiMap, from the “Lidar Scotland 1m Phase 1” dataset, and is a very high resolution DEM for the Dumyat hill, just behind the university campus. Load all five datasets (from the nn and ns folder) into your project. Notice they are a different format, called XYZ Asc or .asc. Description here: https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/webhelp/digimapsupport/common_help/data_download/data_formats.htm#XYZ Stop and think: Why do the loaded files have very apparent “seams” between each data file? Go to Raster &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Merge.... Click on the ... button to the left of Input Layers, and select the five new Lidar rasters you loaded. Run and Close. Stop and think: - What did we just do with our rasters? Why is that a big black area around the elevation data? Go to Raster &gt; Extraction &gt; Clip Raster by Extent.... Select your mosaic (that is the name we give to several rasters “stitched” together&quot;) as Input Layer and then click on the ... button to the left of Clipping Extent. Select the option Select extent on canvas.... The window will disappear for a moment. Click on the top left corner of the main terrain data area and draw a tight rectangle around it, excluding most of the black areas and the little bit of extra data on the bottom left. Once you finish drawing, will be taken back to the Clip window. Before clicking Run, set the actual file name to save this time, using Dumyat_DTM_5m.tif as the name. Then Run and Close. Then remove all of the previous separate LiDAR elevation layers and load only this final file. Set the style for Dumyat layer, and then copy it ((Right click on layer name) &gt; Styles &gt; Copy Style) and paste it on the UK_SRTM_masked_BSG data set. Drag it to just under the Dumyat layer, and turn it on and off to compare the difference between looking at elevation data at 5 meters instead of 90 meters. You may want to use the Hillshade visual trick learned on the previous practical to help emphasize the differences. Just remeber to turn both the elevation and the hill shade on and off at the same time when comparing. Stop and think: What is the problem of using hillshade on the SRTM data at this map scale? (Have you ever played the game called Minecraft?) Compute aspect and slope for the Dumyat DEM, and compare it with SRTM derived aspect and slope as well. Now turn off all layers except for the Dumyat DEM and its hillshade. Go to View &gt; New 3D map view. It will open a new window. Make the window larger by dragging its corners, and the click on the Configure (wrench) button. Change the type from Flat terrain to DEM(Raster layer), and select the Dumyat_DTM_5m layer as the Elevation, then click Ok. Use the navigation controls to tilt, zoom and pan your 3D visualization. Then go back to the Configure menu and change Vertical scale to 5. Stop and think: what does the Vertical scale parameter do? Sometimes countour lines can make terrain information more interpretable. Go to Raster &gt; Extraction &gt; Contours.... Select your DEM as the Input Layer, a contour spacing of 10 meters, and Run, then Close. Stop and think: what data format are the countours stored? 6.4 Formative Assessment Let us revisit the previous formative assignment, now empowered with our ability to mix vectors and rasters in the same analysis. Is there any difference in mean values of average annual temperature between urban areas and forests in the UK? Make a map (including legend and scale) showing you results visually. HINT: there is an already vectorized land cover dataset on the folder for Lab 5 data. But it is for the whole of the EU. Luckily, you already know how to do spatial selections or attribute selections using vectors, so using your previous knowledge and/or previous lab data, you should be able to extract the UK from the CORINE dataset as a new vector. Does aspect affect annual average temperature and total annual precipitation in the UK? For reference, use the following categories: Table 6.1: Cardinal directions in angles Direction Aspect.range North 337.5° - 360° and 0° - 22.5° Northeast 22.5° - 67.5° East 67.5° - 112.5° Southeast 112.5° - 157.5° South 157.5° - 202.5° Southwest 202.5° - 247.5° West 247.5° - 292.5° Northwest 292.5° - 337.5° Stop and think: Why do we need to separate “North” into two angle ranges?

["lab6.html", "7 Lab 6 - Interpolating data 7.1 Guided Exercise 1 - Creating distance rasters 7.2 Guided exercise 2 - Density Estimation 7.3 Guided exercise 3 - Interpolating values 7.4 Formative assessment", " 7 Lab 6 - Interpolating data A common task in spatial analysis is to use interpolation methods to “fill the gaps” between discrete objects, usually vector points. In this lab, we will learn a few of the most common methods for generating interpolated surfaces from points. 7.1 Guided Exercise 1 - Creating distance rasters During vector analysis, we learned to use buffers to delimit areas of equal distance from individual vector features. However, sometimes what you need is a continuous estimate of distances from objects. Lets say, for example, that you are interested in knowing which areas of London are furthest away from a school, to aid in city planning. Get the files for Lab from the usual module data folder: https://stir-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ts35_stir_ac_uk/En54tCrr8_NNl9dCo9Wa2hEB_O_BaNWlqbZVbs4yQu6plQ?e=r0vDfx Load and inspect the vector files contained in the “London_schools” and “London-wards-2014” folders. This data came from the London Data Store website: https://data.london.gov.uk/. Important: Notice that the ward data is provided on an usual vector format. This is the proprietary format of the MapInfo GIS software. It works similarly to a shapefile, and the main file to be loaded is the .tab file (the equivalent of the .shp). Enable your “Processing Toolbox” if it is not enabled by going to Processing &gt; Toolbox or typing Ctrl+Alt+T. Then search for the Proximity (raster distance) tool. Oh no, the tool only takes raster data. We need to convert our school data to raster then. But first, we need to create a simple value that just indicates “Yes, there is a school here”. So we go to the school layer Attribute Table, and use the Field Calculator to create a new field called “school”, and as the formula, simply enter a value of 1. Don’t forget to set your data type to Integer. Once you created the attribute, save and exit editing mode to avoid unwanted edits. No we go to Raster &gt; Conversion &gt; Rasterize (Vector to Raster).... We then select our school layer as the Input Layer and the school attribute as the Burn-in Attribute. That means pixels that contain a school will have a value of 1 on our new raster. Unlike when we are converting rasters ro vectors, going from a vector to a raster requires us to make a decision of what will the output pixel size (resolution) be, since vectors have no inherent resolution. Here we will use a pixel size of 10m. So we set the output raster unit to Georeferenced units, and the Horizontal Resolution and Vertical Resolution both to 10. We also need to define the extent that our raster will cover. As the schools layer already extends beyond the city bounds, we can just use the bounding box of this layer as our extent. So we click on the ... button to the left of the Output Extent box, then select Use layer extent... and then select our school layer from the list. Stop and Think: what would you consider when deciding the pixel resolution and extent of your new raster? What are the implications of choosing a given pixel size and raster extent? Finally, it is important to think about the resulting file data type. Under Advanced Parameters, you will notice the Output Data Type option, which is set to Float32 by default. We can change it to byte. Then we can give our layer a proper name and save it on its relevant location within our project structure, and Run the algorithm. Stop and Think: what do byte and Float32 mean in this context? What are the implications of choosing one versus the other? DO NOT DESPAIR. It may seem like the result is blank, but it is just a matter of the 10m pixels being too small to be visible (if you are at the necessary map scale to see the whole extent of London). Pick any school point and zoom into it, and you will see that there is a tiny pixel overlapping it. All the non-school pixels are set as no data, so they are by default transparent. If you’d rather see the full extent of the raster, go to its “Properties”, and then on the Transparency tab unckeck the option No data value, then manually add the 0 value to your scale using the + button on the Symbology tab. Now we can go back to our proximity tool, either from the Processing pane or from the menu on Raster &gt; Analysis &gt; Proximity (raster distance). We pick our school raster layer as the input, set our target pixel value to 1 and our distance units to Georeferenced Coordinates. This time we need to keep the data type as Float32, since the distances in meters will be real (decimal) numbers. Style and inspect your raster layer. By visual analysis only, can you spot any particular wards that seem to have better or worse than average access to schools? Let’s use what we already to know to make this analysis more quantitative. Calculate, for each ward, what is the maximum distance to a school within each ward, and then style the ward polygon layer to show this information. 7.2 Guided exercise 2 - Density Estimation Another way to approach the problem above would be to consider where are the regions with the lowest school density, meaning how close or spread apart are the schools along the London territory. To know that, we can use a tool called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). You can think of a kernel as a magnifying glass we use to look at each individual point and its neighborhood, and the density estimation as the point counts we get as we move from neighborhood to neighborhood. Go to the “Processing Toolbox” and search for the Heatmap (Kernel Density Estimation) function. Choose the school points vector layer as the input, and you leave your Radius as 1000. Set your Pixel Size as 10, and notice that this particular tool already matches the raster size to the extent of your chosen layer. Run your algorithm and style the results using a sequential or diverging color ramp. Experiment with a few different kernel radii (but be aware that larger radius = longer processing time). Now choose your preferred radius and experiment with changing the kernel functions. This changes the relative weight of the neighbouring points according to their distance from the center point. The default is Quartic. A very cool new feature of QGIS 3 is that instead of generating heatmaps as new layers, you can use it as a layer style. Go to the Symbology of your school layer, and choose the heatmap coloring option. You will notice there is a more limited choice of parameters, but it works well if all you need is a quick heatmap for visual purposes. However, using this option you will not be able to access the actual density values. Important: Because the results of the KDE are completely dependent on the radius and kernel function, KDEs are considered more of a visual (or semi-quantitative) tool. Be careful with your use of this tool, since you can impose very different interpretations on the same data. For example: Style the schools layer using a radius of 1000 and apply. You could use this image to build an argument that school coverage in London is fairly homogeneous but “spotty”, with a couple of hotspots. Change the radius to 10000. Now you could spin a story about the center of London having much better school access than the outer regions. Now drag the slider all the way towards fastest and use a radius of 100,000. You could use this to say all of London has excellent school access. 7.3 Guided exercise 3 - Interpolating values So far, our interpolations were based only on the position of the points, be it interms of distances or densities. However, it is common to want to interpolate the actual attribute values. For example, let us look at some water geochemistry data from an Amazon lake. Go to the Amazon_water_data folder from the Lab 6 data on Windows File Explorer (not the QGIS browser). You will see all data there is in .csv format (Comma-Separated Values). This is a very simple and universal text format for data tables, where commas are used to separate the data from each column. Right click on any of the files and select Open with &gt; Notepad. You will see the structure of the CSV file. On QGIS, go to the Open Data Source Manager window (the “multiple squares” icon on the toolbar). The select the option Delimited Text. Click on the ...button to find the sample_locs_june.csv file, and select it. See that QGIS is smart enough to guess which columns have the coordinates, but if it ever doesn’t, you can just select them manually. The set the projection to WGS-84/UTM Zone 21S (search for EPSG:32721). Then click on Add. To help you locate yourself in the world, load the Open Layers base map as a background. The points correspond to locations where water samples where collected for posterior lab analysis. Inspect the attribute table of the points you have imnported. We have location data but not geochemistry data. The geochemnistry measurements are on a separate scv file, called water_params_june.csv. We will need to join these data to the location data. A join is a database operation where two tables are combined into one based on a common attribute. First, open the water_params_june.csv the same way you imported the locations CSV file, but this time pick the option no geometry (attribute table only). It will be brought in as a table. You can look at it by viweing it as an attribute table, but there are no spatial objects linked to this table (yet). Go to the Properties window of the sample locations point layer, and then select the Joins tab. Click on the + sign at the bottom to create a new join. Select the Join Layer as the water_params_june.csv, and both the Join Attribute and the Target Attribute as location. That means the tables will be matched based on the values of this attribute. Click on Custom Field Name Prefix and delete the default, leaving it blank, then click Ok and close the Properties window. Inspect the attribute table of the sample locations layer again. You will now see all the columns of the water parameter table were added to it. Save (Export) your layer as a geopackage, and add it to the project. Stop and Think: what happens to the variable names if you Export it as a shapefile? Why? There is an attribute called water_params_june.p.tot (Total Phosphorus). It records the total concentration of phosphorus in the water sample from each location, which is usually related to the fertility of the site. Could we use these points to estimate the distribution of phosphorus in the entire lake? The first interpolation method we will use is called Inverse Distance Weighting, or IDW. This method calculates the value at each new location as a weighted average of the surrounding data points, weighted by their distance to the location. So near points contribute more to the interpolation than far points. Search for IDW interpolation on the Processing pane, and open it. Select your geopackage layer as the Vector layer and p.tot as the Interpolation attribute. Then click on the + sign to add it to the table. This is a handy feature that lets you interpolate several variables at once. Select the extent of the points layer itself as the extent for the raster, and pick a pixel size of 50m (this lake is a bit larger than London). Style and evaluate your result. You can use transparency to see it against the lake edges from Open Layers. The Distance coefficient P option of IDW interpolation controls the relative weighting of the point values per distance. Try a few different values to see how it affects your results. If processing time is too long, use larger raster cell sizes. Another type of interpolation is called a Triangulated Irregular Network. This method draws triangles connecting each point, and then estimate the values for each triangle based on the vertices. Search for TIN interpolation on the Processing pane, and open it. Select your geopackage layer as the Vector layer and p.tot as the Interpolation attribute. Then click on the + sign to add it to the table. Select the extent of the points layer itself as the extent for the raster, and pick a pixel size of 50m. Important: TIN interpolation is normally used for interpolating terrain data, from datasets that have a very dense and regular distribution of point samples across the location. If there are not enough points, it can generate many artifatcs, like in the above example. 7.4 Formative assessment Determine which areas of the Amazon lake above have the highest change in total phosphorus (p.tot) and total nitrogen (Nitrite + Nitrate + Ammonia) between April and June. Do phosphorus or nitrate concentrations seem to be correlated with the amount of suspended material in the water (tss)? A visual analysis is sufficient. "],
