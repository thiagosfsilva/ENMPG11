Questions of this nature sent via e-mail will not be replied to. Requests for extension on assignments should be submitted directly through CANVAS without the need to send a prior e-mail to the module coordinator. Questions regarding personal and/or sensitive issues related to the module should be sent directly by e-mail to the module coordinator. Please add the keyword ENMPG11 to your e-mail subject. 1.2 About the Module Geomatics is defined in the ISO/TC 211 standards as the “discipline concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of geographic data or geographic information”.It is an integrative discipline encompassing Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Earth Observation (EO, a.k.a Remote Sensing), and satial surveying methods. These technologies have become vitally important tools in ecological and environmental management and are being increasingly used by scientists, governmental agencies and NGOs for the assessment, monitoring and management of global resources. This course will provide an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of GIS and EO, and how they are now widely used to support ecological and environmental management objectives. You will be introduced to modern methods for manipulating and analysing geospatial data of various sources and formats. Hands-onpractical sessions will examine various real-world applications of GIS and EO in environmental management. As the name implies, Geo-matics can be tought as “informatics for geographic data”. This is a computer intensive module that will require you to be comfortable using complex computer software and knowlegeable in managing files and folders. Also, as with any complex piece software, stuff will not work at some point. This is regardless of software source, version, vendor of platform. Learning how to independently troubleshoot when things don’t work as expected is a MAJOR part of being proficient in Geomatics, so be prepared for it! 1.3 Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO’s): By the end of this module, you should be able to: Select and apply appropriate GIS/EO functions based on spatial theory; Describe the physical principles underlying remote sensing in the optical and microwave domains and the respective uses of the data provided by these sensors; Critically differentiate sources and structures of geospatial datasets; Analyse and visualise geospatial data using open source software and programming languages. 1.4 Readings and Resources There are no prescribed textbooks, but some readings are suggested below. Students are expected to read widely from the peer-reviewed literature to consolidate their understanding of course materials. Textbooks: Heywood D.I., Cornelius S., &amp; Carver S. 2006.

To access it, go to the University Portal and click on this link, at the left of the page: There are also apps available for Android and iOS. To log in, select “Login through your institution” after installing. In particular, we will make use of some of the recorded lectures of the “Learning QGIS” course by Gordon Luckett: Link to QGIS course on Linkeding Learning Be aware that there is an older version of this course on the LL platform called “Learning QGIS 2015”, which is based on QGIS version 2. We will use QGIS 3 on this course. Another very good video resource are the QGIS videos by Klas Karlsson on YouTube. They are usually very long and in-depth, but even after using QGIS for almost 10 years I still learn a thing or two every time I watch them: Klas Karlsson QGIS Videos on YouTube 1.5 Attendance and Points of Contact Student attendance and engagement will be recorded by monitoring attendance or participation at designated Points of Contact. For this module, your Points of Contact are as follows: 1. Lab practicals on Week 1 (Thu), Week 4 (Mon), Week 8 (Thu) 2. Lectures on Week 2, Week 9 1.6 Class Schedule and Structure We will meet twice a week for practical sessions at the following times and locations: Monday 10:00h - 13:00h - Cottrell 3A146 Tuesday 10:00h - 13:00h - Cottrell 3A146 Most practical sessions will be structured as follows: 10:00-11:00: Discussion of recorded material with follow-along hands-on demonstrations of the tools and concepts by main instructor; 11:00-12:00: Hands-on exercises following guidance provided by the module workbook, with instructor/tutor support available; 12:00-13:00: Independent work on an invidiual problem assignment (formative or summative), with tutor support available. 1.7 Assessment and Grading This module is assessed by coursework only. Coursework should be submitted in electronic format through CANVAS as responses to Quizzes or as a PDF. Assessment feedback will be given online via CANVAS, and standard penalties for late submission will apply. If you require an extension for any assessed work, please submit an extension request through CANVAS before the due date for the assignment. For the Extenuating Circumstances Form and the current BES Handbook can also be found here. The final grade for this module will be based on a set of weekly summative hands-on problems, and on a final open-themed individual project: 1) Hands-on problems (50% of final grade) At the end of every practical session, you will be assigned either a formative or summative hands-on problem to be worked on individually. The last hour of each practical session will be dedicated to work on these problems under tutor support, but they can be at any time before the due date. These assignments will assess ILOs 1, 3, and 4. Each summative assignment must be completed before the release date of the next summative assignment. Formative assignments can be completed at any time. 2) Final individual project (50% of the final grade) You will be required to complete an individual piece of project work, following the guidelines provided here. The deliverable for this project will be a document to be formatted as a if it were a journal article to be submitted to a geomatics journal (no actual journal submission in necessary). Starting at week 11, all of your class time will be reserved for you to work on your project, with support from the instructor and tutor. The project is due at the last day of teaching for the semester. The project assesses ILO’s 1-4. This assessment is compulsory (i.e. failure to submit these compulsory pieces of work will result in an X grade). 1.8 Module Timetable and Dates Table 1.1: ENMPG Timetable - Spring2020 Week Unit Activity type Topic Date 1 Introduction to Geomatics Recorded Lectures Introduction to Geomatics Monday Lab No class 2020-01-13 Thursday Lab Self teaching from Linkedin (home assignment) 2020-01-16 2 Spatial data types Recorded Lectures Spatial Data Types: vectors / rasters Monday Lab Project management and data handling in QGIS 2020-01-20 Thursday Lab Working with vector data 2020-01-23 3 Spatial Operations I - Vector data Recorded lectures Vector geometry spatial operations / vector attribute operations Monday Lab Working with raster data 2020-01-27 Thursday Lab Spatial operations with vectors - geoprocessing 2020-01-30 4 Spatial Operations II - Raster data Recorded Lectures Raster spatial operations Monday Lab Spatial operations with vectors - attributes 2020-02-03 Thursday Lab Raster spatial operations 2020-02-06 5 Combining vectors and rasters Recorded lectures Zonal statistics / interpolation / cost analysis / raster algebra Monday Lab Raster terrain analysis 2020-02-10 Thursday Lab Combined spatial analysis 2020-02-13 6 Reading Week No classes this week 2020-02-17 No classes this week 2020-02-20 7 Digital Cartography Recorded lectures Cartographic principles thematic mapping data visualization principles Monday Lab Combined exercises, all previous topics (Assignment 1) 2020-02-24 Thursday Lab Digital cartography 2020-02-27 8 Remote Sensing Recorded Lectures Elementary physical principles Digital remote sensing Monday Lab Remote sensing data sources and download 2020-03-02 Thursday Lab Remote sensing image visualization / digitization 2020-03-05 9 Programmatic Geomatics Recorded Lectures Python / R introductory videos linkedin learning Monday Lab Programmatic Geomatics in Python 2020-03-09 Thursday Lab Programmatic Geomatics in R 2020-03-12 10 Data Collection Recorded Lectures Field data collection and classification validation Monday Lab Basic satellite image classification in R and Python 2020-03-16 Thursday Lab Data collection and classification validation 2020-03-19 11 Project Work Monday Lab Assisted project work 2020-03-23 Thursday Lab Assisted project work 2020-03-26 12 Project Work Monday Lab Assisted project work 2020-03-30 Thursday Lab Assisted Project Work 2020-04-02 Project Due Date: 2020-04-14 1.9 Other Relevant Information Student attendance Please note that attendance at all practical classes is prescribed and support outside of timetabled hours cannot be guaranteed for students who fail to attend classes. Student attendance and engagement will be recorded by monitoring attendance or other participation at designated Academic Points of Contact detailed in the Module Outline. If a student fails to engage with one or more Academic Points of Contact, the module coordinator will contact the student to ascertain the reason for this and to encourage greater academic engagement. A list of acceptable and unacceptable reasons for absence can be found in the MSc Handbook. You should familiarise yourself with the Handbook for other guidance and requirements including an outline of the Common Grading Scheme. The minimum grade to obtain a pass for a module is 50%. The overall mark for the module is calculated from the sum of weighted component marks rounded to the nearest whole number; a pass is not required in each component. This module mark represents a summary of performance on that module. All assignments are to be submitted electronically via CANVAS Quizzes or as PDFs. Work that is submitted late will be returned with no feedback and graded with an appropriate penalty (3% per day late). Work that is handed in more than 7 days late will achieve a zero grade. Under some circumstances as outlined in the Student Handbook, extensions to the deadline for submission may be granted. Requests for such extensions must be completed on the appropriate form in advance of the submission deadline and emailed to the Module Coordinator. Retrospective applications for extensions will not be granted. "]
