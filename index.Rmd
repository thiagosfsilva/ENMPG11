# Welcome! {-}

Welcome to the ENMPG11 Geomatics module workbook! This module provides an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of Geomatics, i.e. how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Earth Observation (EO) to perform spatial data analysis and visualisation. As Geomatics is best taught through hands-on practice, this module is based on the flipped classroom method, where you will be assigned videos and/or readings on a weekly basis, and then we will meet twice a week for computer-based practicals. In each practical class you will be taken through a number of exercises that will teach you fundamental skills in GIS and EO.

Use the items on the left to navigate through the sections of the workbook, and click on the arrows at the left and right edges of the main page are to page forward/backward. If you are viewing the book on a small screen, the navigation buttons will be on the bottom instead.
