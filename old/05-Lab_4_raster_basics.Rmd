# Lab 4 - Working with raster data - the basics {#lab4}

So far, we have been working within the realm of vector data: beautiful topological combinations of vertices and lines to represent the complexity of the Earth's surface. But there are plenty of situations where vectors are not the best choice; any information that varies *gradually* and *continuously* over the surface can be better represented by *rasters*

For this exercise, we will learn to inspect and style raster data, and also how to do some mathematical operations among raster layers.

## Guided Exercise 1 - Opening and inspecting raster data

1. Download the required data for Lab 4 from the lab data link on Canvas.

2. Download additional data from [](https://gadm.org/). You want the offical country divisions for the United Kingdom. Pick Geopackage or Shapefile, your choice.
    
3. Open the four layers contained in the UK administrative boundary data. Keep the layer that shows only the overall boundaries for the UK, and remove the others from the project.

4. Add the `UK_SRTM.tif`, `UK_Bioclim.tif` and `CLC2018_CLC2018_V2018_20_UKclip.tif` raster files to your project. For each of them, right-click on the layer name and go to `Properties > Information`, then:

```{block type='rmdnote'}
**Stop and think:** 

- What are the datasets you have?

- What are the file *types* you have to work with?

- What are the file *formats* you have to work with?

- What are the *map projections* of each dataset you have (vector and raster)?

- What are the *lenght units* of each raster dataset?

- What are the *data types* of each raster dataset?

- What are the *dimensions (rows, columns)* of each raster dataset?

- How many *bands* does each raster dataset have?

- What are the *pixel sizes* of each raster dataset?
```

## Guided Exercise 2 - Styling raster data

1. Select the CORINE land cover data layer and go to `Properties > Symbology`. Not that the default symbology for single band rasters is `Singleband gray`. Change it to `Paletted / Unique Values`. Maintain the `Random Colors` option, and classify. Aplly the result to your raster and visualise it.

```{block type='rmdnote'}
**Stop and think:** 

- How many categories are there on this raster?

- What do the numbers represent?
```

2. Fortunately for us, the data producers of CORINE include a color map file as part of the *metadata*. Back on the *Symbology* window, click on the `...` to the right of `Delete All` and choose `Load Color Map from File...`. Find and select the metadata file named  `CLC2018_CLC2018_V2018_20_QGIS.txt`. `Apply` and then click `OK`. Thank you CORINE team! 

3. Now go to the *Symbology* window for the Bioclim dataset. Notice that the default symbology choice for multiband rasters is `Multiband color`. That option is appropriate for satellite images and aerial photography, where each band represents a different region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and then bands can be assigned to the Red, Green and Blue color channels of your screen. 

4. Since our data does not comprise images, but layers where pixel values represent *real variables*, we need to use the `Single band - pseudocolor` option. Choose the `bio1` band, and select the `magma` color ramp. `Classify` the existing values and then `Apply` and click `OK`.

```{block type='rmdnote'}
**Stop and think:** 

- What data is bio01 showing?

- What units are the minimum and maximum values shown on the color scale?

- Why such a strange choice for the units?
```

5. Return to the *Symbology* window, and expand the option `Min / Max Value Settings`. What is the default option selected? Experiment with the other options (with different percent clips and standard deviations) and see how the Symbology changes. Remember to `Apply` the changes every time you change any options.

6. Still on the *Symbology* window, change the `Classification` options (drop down menu to the left, under the classes) from `Continuous` to `Equal Interval`. To the right of it, select the numnber of classes as 3. `Apply` and evaluate.

7. Without changing your number of classes, change the `Interpolation` option above the classes from `Linear` to `Discrete`. `Apply` and evaluate. Take some time to play with these visualisation options to analyse the distribution of different Bioclimatic variables in the UK, and think what they mean for plants, (non-human) animals and in terms of social and economic factors.

8. Finally, let's work on the Symbology for the SRTM data. On the *Symbology* window, choose the `Singleband Pseudocolor` option, and then  on the `Color Ramp` option, select `Create New Color Ramp`. On the small options window that comes up, select `Catalog:cpt-city`.

9. Once the catalog window opens, go to the `Topography` list and select the `cd-a` palette. Then classify your elevation values using the `User Defined` Min /Max option, and type 0 as Min and 900 as Maximum. `Apply` and visualise. Then, befor closing the *Properties* window, go to the `Transparency` table and drag the slider at the top to around 60%.

10. Right-click on the SRTM layer name and select `Duplicate layer`. Then on the *Symbology* of the copied layer, change the `render type` to `Hillshade`. `Apply` and close the window. Make sure the copied layer is immediately under the original layer, and alternate each layer between on and off. 

```{block type='rmdnote'}
**Stop and think:** 

- What does the `hillshade` render style does? How? 

```

## Guided Exercise 3 - Mathematical and boolean operations using the Raster Calculator

1. Go to the menu `Raster > Raster Calculator...`. This tool allows you to apply several mathematical funtions to raster layer values and even to do calculations among values.

2. First, find the Bio1 layer of the Biolcim raster. From the metadata, we know it is the first band, so double-click `UK_bioclim@1` to add it to the expression area. In this context `@1`, `@2`, etc. indicate the respective raster band number.

3. As we saw above, the Bio1 layer corresponds to Annual Average Temperature, with a unit of degrees Celsius multiplied by ten. Let's convert it to regular degree Celsius units. On the expression area, after  `UK_bioclim@1`, write `/ 10`. Then, on the top right corner, select a folder to save your file and name it appropriately. Then click `OK`.

4. Style your new layer in the same style used for the original Bio1 layer, using the full Min / Max range, and marvel at the abysmal maximum average temperature values for the UK. Can you spot the London heat island effect?

5. Let's say we would like to relocate to the hottest (in average) locations of the UK. Go back to raster calculator, and enter the expression `UK_bioclim@1 > 100` (or use your new layer and select areas > 10). Save the result as `UKs_last_hope.tif`. 

6. Go to the *Symbology* layer of your newly created layer and select `Paletted / Unique Values`, then `Classify`. Then, remove the `0` values from the legend using the `-` (minus) button. Click on the color box for the `1` values and select a strong red color. Finally, go to the `Transparency` tab and drag the slider to around 50%. Then `Apply` and close the window. Position your temperature range layer just above the terrain and hillshade layers, and make sure only these three are visible.

## Guided Exercise 3 - Masking and reprojecting raster data.

1. It may have been bothering you that the UK seems "squished" during your work. That is because the data is 'unprojected', using only the WGS-84 datum geograophic coordinates. Although data in geographic coordinates is often referred to as "unprojected", this is not actually true (you are looking at it on flat screen, right?). For these "unprojected" datasets, what most GIS software do is to simply use a linear function to convert latitudes and longitudes in degrees to x and y values on your screen. This projection can be referred as *Plate CarrÃ©e* or *Equirectangular* projection, where degree coordinates are simply converted to radians and multiplied by a scale factor to become x and y coordinates. This projection has a heavy amount of distortion towards the poles:

2. To reproject the data, go to `Raster > Projections > Warp (Reproject...)`. Select your SRTM layer as the `Input Layer`, and the `EPSG: 27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid` as the output projection. Set the `output file resolution` to 90 (this will be in meters, as meters are the units of the BNG projection). Then save your file as `UK_SRTM_BNGreproj.tif`. `Run` the algorithm and then `Close` when finished. Repeat the process for the Bioclim layer (use a cell size of 1000m), your "last hope" layer and the CORINE landcover map (cell size of 100m).

3. It seems nothing has really changed, right? That is because QGIS does reprojections "on the fly" to make sure the data in the screen are as best aligned as possible. As the project always takes the Coordinate System of the first layer added to it, it is set to Geographic WGS84, and it is reprojecting your BSG files back to WGS84 to align them with the WGS84 data. CLose your project, and then start a new project, loading only the BSG reprojected layers. Does it look better now?

4. We often want to remove parts (specific cells) of a raster, a process called `masking`. For example, let's say we want to get the mean average annual temperature andvisualize the temprature ranges for out "last hope" regions only. Lets go to the *Raster Calculator*, and use the expression `(UK_Biolcim@1 / 10) * UKs_last_hope@1`. Name the resulting layer and save it, then style the result using a *Pseudocolor*  color ramp. However, this time manually specify the Min value as `10`.

```{block type='rmdnote'}
**Stop and think:** what happened to the temperature values when we applied the expression above? Use the information tool to probe a few values of the new raster to help you think about it.
```

5. Return to the *Properties* of the new masked layer, and select the `Transparency` tab. On the table named `Transparent pixel list`, click on the `+` (plus) button to add a new line. Fill the line with the values `from` = `0`, `to` = `0` and `Percent Transparent` = `100`. `Apply` and evaluate the result.

```{block type='rmdnote'}
**Stop and think:** did you actually change the contents of the raster layer when you set the transparent pixels?
```

6. Vectors can also be used as masks. Go to `Raster > Extraction > CLip Raster by Mask Layer...`. Select your Celsius converted average temperature raster as input layer, the gadm36_GBR_0 as your mask layer, and check `keep the resolution of the input raster`. `Run` the algorithm (it will take a while) then `Close` the window when finished. Copy the layer style from the original UK_SRTM to the masked layer, zoom to the original UK_SRTM layer extent and compare the results before and after the masking.

7. Now click on the menu `Processing > Toolbox...`. Welcome to the QGIS toolbox! You will find many addtional functions here to process vectors ans rasters, as well as functions from external software that can be accesses through QGIS. On the search bar at the top, search for `Raster layer zonal statistics`. Double click on the tool with that name that comes up from the search. As `Input layer`, select the degree Celsius temeprature layer you created, and as `Zones layer`, select the "last hope" layer (the one with the 0/1 values, not the masked temoerature layer). `Run` (it will take a while) and then `Close`.


## Formative Assessment

Is there any difference in mean values of average annual temperature between  urban areas and forests in the UK? Make a map (including legend and scale) showing you results visually.

Hint 1: To ensure raster operations work properly, all rasters must be in the same projection.

Hint 2: You can also use `AND` and `OR` to create compound expressions on the raster calculator (just make sure you type them in all caps).
