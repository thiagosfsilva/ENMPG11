Welcome to the ENMPG11 Geomatics module workbook! This module provides an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of Geomatics, i.e.~how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Earth Observation (EO) to perform spatial data analysis and visualisation. As Geomatics is best taught through hands-on practice, this module is based on the flipped classroom method, where you will be assigned videos and/or readings on a weekly basis, and then we will meet twice a week for computer-based practicals. In each practical class you will be taken through a number of exercises that will teach you fundamental skills in GIS and EO.

Use the items on the left to navigate through the sections of the workbook, and click on the arrows at the left and right edges of the main page are to page forward/backward. If you are viewing the book on a small screen, the navigation buttons will be on the bottom instead.

\hypertarget{about-the-module}{%
\section{About the Module}\label{about-the-module}}

Geomatics is defined in the \href{https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/\#iso:std:iso:tr:19122:ed-1:v1:en}{ISO/TC 211 standards} as the ``\emph{discipline concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of geographic data or geographic information}''.It is an integrative discipline encompassing Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Earth Observation (EO, a.k.a Remote Sensing), and satial surveying methods.

These technologies have become vitally important tools in ecological and environmental management and are being increasingly used by scientists, governmental agencies and NGOs for the assessment, monitoring and management of global resources. This course will provide an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of GIS and EO, and how they are now widely used to support ecological and environmental management objectives.

You will be introduced to modern methods for manipulating and analysing geospatial data of various sources and formats. Hands-onpractical sessions will examine various real-world applications of GIS and EO in environmental management.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
As the name implies, Geo-\emph{matics} can be tought as ``informatics for geographic data''. This is a computer intensive module that will require you to be comfortable using complex computer software and knowlegeable in managing files and folders. Also, as with any complex piece software, \textbf{stuff will not work at some point}. This is regardless of software source, version, vendor of platform. \textbf{Learning how to independently troubleshoot when things don't work as expected is a MAJOR part of being proficient in Geomatics, so be prepared for it!}

In addition, we will make use of the \emph{Linkedin Learning} online instructional platform, which University of Stirling subscribes to. To access it, go to the University Portal and click on this link, at the left of the page:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{images/linkedin_image} \end{center}

There are also apps available for Android and iOS. To log in, select ``Login through your institution'' after installing.

In particular, we will make use of some of the recorded lectures of the ``Learning QGIS'' course by Gordon Luckett

\href{https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-qgis-2/}{Link to QGIS course on Linkeding Learning}

Be aware that there is an older version of this course on the LL platform called ``Learning QGIS 2015'', which is based on QGIS version 2. We will use QGIS 3 on this course.

Another very good video resource are the QGIS videos by Klas Karlsson on YouTube. They are usually very long and in-depth, but even after using QGIS for almost 10 years I still learn a thing or two every time I watch them:

\section{Assessment and Grading}\label{assessment-and-grading}}

This module is assessed by coursework only. Coursework should be submitted in electronic format through CANVAS as responses to Quizzes or as a PDF. Assessment feedback will be given online via CANVAS, and standard penalties for late submission will apply. If you require an extension for any assessed work, please submit an extension request through CANVAS before the due date for the assignment.
\textbf{\emph{For the Extenuating Circumstances Form and the current BES Handbook can also
be found here.}}

The final grade for this module will be based on a set of weekly summative hands-on problems, and on a final open-themed individual project:

\hypertarget{hands-on-problems-50-of-final-grade}{%
\subsection*{1) Hands-on problems (50\% of final grade)}\label{hands-on-problems-50-of-final-grade}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1) Hands-on problems (50\% of final grade)}

At the end of every practical session, you will be assigned either a \emph{formative} or \emph{summative} hands-on problem to be worked on individually. The last hour of each practical session will be dedicated to work on these problems under tutor support, but they can be at any time before the due date. These assignments will assess ILOs 1, 3, and 4.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
\textbf{Each summative assignment must be completed before the release date of the next summative
assignment}. Formative assignments can be completed at any time.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

\hypertarget{final-individual-project-50-of-the-final-grade}{%
\subsection*{2) Final individual project (50\% of the final grade)}\label{final-individual-project-50-of-the-final-grade}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2) Final individual project (50\% of the final grade)}

You will be required to complete an individual piece of project work, following the guidelines provided here. The deliverable for this project will be a document to be formatted as a if it were a journal article to be submitted to a geomatics journal (no actual journal submission in necessary). Starting at week 11, all of your class time will be reserved for you to work on your project, with support from the instructor and tutor. The project is due at the last day of teaching for the semester. The project assesses ILO's 1-4.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
\textbf{This assessment is compulsory} (i.e.~failure to submit these compulsory pieces of work will
result in an X grade).

\textbf{Student attendance}

Please note that attendance at all practical classes is prescribed and support outside of timetabled hours cannot be guaranteed for students who fail to attend classes.
Student attendance and engagement will be recorded by monitoring attendance or other participation at designated Academic Points of Contact detailed in the Module Outline. If a student fails to engage with one or more Academic Points of Contact, the module coordinator will contact the student to ascertain the reason for this and to encourage greater academic engagement. A list of acceptable and unacceptable reasons for absence can be found in the MSc Handbook.

You should familiarise yourself with the Handbook for other guidance and requirements including an outline of the Common Grading Scheme. The minimum grade to obtain a pass for a module is 50\%. The overall mark for the module is calculated from the sum of weighted component marks rounded to the nearest whole number; a pass is not required in each component. This module mark represents a summary of performance on that module.

All assignments are to be submitted electronically via CANVAS Quizzes or as PDFs. Work that is submitted late will be returned with no feedback and graded with an appropriate penalty (3\% per day late). Work that is handed in more than 7 days late will achieve a zero grade. Under some circumstances as outlined in the Student Handbook, extensions to the deadline for submission may be granted. Requests for such extensions must be completed on the appropriate form in advance of the submission deadline and emailed to the Module Coordinator. Retrospective applications for
extensions will not be granted.
